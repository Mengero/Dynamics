Acceleration on the edge of the gear is different from the velocity on the edge of the gear.
For the velocity, if the gears are in touch with each other, then all the velocities have the same magnitude.
However, for the acceleration, if the gears are in touch, then consider the centripital acceleration, which is closely related to the radius
of the gear.
